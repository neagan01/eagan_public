    "Many in chemical engineering who are new to Python are transitioning from MATLAB, the main software originally introduced throughout the curriculum. MATLAB is different from Python in a few key ways. MATLAB and Python are both computing languages, but a MATLAB download comes with its own set of packages and its own interface. Python, on the other hand, is only a computing language. It is used with a range of customized packages and various interfaces known as \"integrated development environments,\" or IDEs. Popular IDE choices include Spyder (which has a fairly MATLAB-esque feel), Jupyter Notebooks (which allows for codes to be provided alongside outputs and interchanged with long text blocks), JupyterLab (an evolution of Jupyter Notebook which brings multiple utilities together), Visual Studio Code (which is similar to JupyterLab but with broader utility), PyCharm, IDLE, Atom, and Thonny."

    "The simplest benefit of Python is that it is free, while MATLAB requires a license which can cost as much as $2,000 or more unless you have lower-cost access through a university.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key difference that has both pros and cons is that Python is not really \"built for\" anything other than being \"intuitive.\" MATLAB, on the other hand, is built deliberately for mathematical work and in many ways more directly useful for solving chemical engineering problems. Python is instead commonly used for not only computation/data science but also for software development, website creation, design, etc. When you are stuck and need help with a certain task, MATLAB's thorough documentation can be a plus. The fact that Python is \"open-source\" makes the documentation de-localized, but many packages still have thorough details online. Furthermore, there is a large community of Python users which discuss challenges and solutions openly on forums such as Stack Overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major \"pro\" for Python that comes from these facts is its adaptability. Those who learn Python can use it anywhere, while those who use MATLAB have to hope they can find a license (or pay for one) to use it. Furthermore, those who learn how to work with Python can apply their knowledge to problems outside the traditional chemical engineering scope. Such skills could enhance communication, foster collaboration, or facilitate a role transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these benefits are very clearly understood by the broader community. The TIOBE organization specializes in evaluating software quality and as of 2023 ranked Python the #1 programming language while MATLAB is listed at only #13 (https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). The 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey finds that Python is the 4th most commonly used language, while MATLAB is 22nd. Other languages of note include Java, JavaScript, C, C++, HTML, and SQL."
